The purpose of the Hsitorian project is to help novice level people get into and refine their skills in many different technological fields
I.E.programing, learning how to read geospacial data, composing\mixing music on computers.

The audience for the project is novice\ entry level people.

I would consider TPH a work of technical writing. It contains many different submitions that explains how to use and work with varying different
technologies and includes instructions on how to do so.
